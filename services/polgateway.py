"""polgateway.py -- a bot's Discord Gateway presence ("Watching 12 players").

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every other Discord call in this project is plain
HTTPS: polboards posts and edits with urllib, polbridge answers interactions,
and neither ever opens a socket Discord keeps. Presence is the one thing that
cannot be done that way -- **Discord has no REST endpoint for a bot's status or
activity**. It is set in the IDENTIFY payload or with Gateway op 3, and nowhere
else. So a bot that says "12 players online" must hold a WebSocket open.

WHY IT IS HAND-ROLLED. The image installs pyyaml, pycryptodome, pymysql and
pillow -- no websocket library -- and the stdlib has no WebSocket client. This
module speaks RFC 6455 over `ssl` directly, the same choice polboards already
made for RFC 8032 (it verifies Ed25519 interaction signatures with the stdlib
rather than take a dependency). Client-side WebSocket is the easy half: we mask
what we send, the server never masks what it sends, and we need exactly one
text channel with ping/pong.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never *receives* anything useful: IDENTIFY asks for
`intents: 0`, so Discord sends us no guild, member or message events at all.
That keeps us out of privileged-intent review entirely -- presence is not an
intent, it is something we push. The only frames we read are the handshake,
heartbeat acks and the reconnect/resume bookkeeping.

A SIDE EFFECT WORTH KNOWING. A bot without this shows as **offline** in the
member list even though its slash commands work (an interactions-only bot has
no Gateway session, and the member list only knows about Gateway sessions).
Once a bot runs this, it finally looks alive.

Use it:

    pres = polgateway.Presence("tm", token, status_fn=lambda: "12 players online")
    pres.start()            # daemon thread; never raises into the caller
    pres.set("13 players online")    # or push, if you'd rather not be polled

Both `set()` and `status_fn` are debounced to Discord's presence limit (5 per
20 seconds per session); see MIN_INTERVAL. Nothing here ever raises into the
host process: a Gateway that will not come up must not take a board down with
it, so every failure is logged and retried with backoff.
